# Loan Default Prediction App 🚀

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not, using machine learning models.  
Multiple algorithms were tested (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and *XGBoost* was chosen as the final model for deployment due to its superior performance.

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numeric values)  
2. Model training & evaluation on multiple algorithms  
3. Model selection → XGBoost chosen as final model  
4. Saving trained model & encoders using Pickle  
5. Deployment via Streamlit (UI)
